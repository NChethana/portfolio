            <h2>My <span>Story</span></h2>
            <p>
                My journey into the world of technology began long before I officially started studying Computer Science. I have always been fascinated by how systems work, how data flows, and how computers can learn patterns the same way humans do. This curiosity slowly grew into a passion, especially when I discovered Machine Learning and Networking — two fields that combine logic, creativity, and innovation.

            <p>
                Choosing Computer Science as my degree was one of the best decisions I’ve made. At Kotelawala Defence University, I was introduced to new challenges, inspiring lecturers, and a competitive environment that pushed me to improve every day. During my studies, I realized that technology isn’t just about writing code; it’s about <b>solving real-world problems and building meaningful solutions </b>.

                A significant turning point in my journey was completing a Machine Learning course from IIT and a Cisco Networking course. These experiences gave me a strong technical foundation and helped me understand how AI systems operate behind the scenes and how secure, efficient networks are built. More importantly, they showed me how powerful these technologies can be when used together.

                But beyond academics, I love exploring new tools, experimenting with ideas, and turning challenges into learning opportunities. I believe in continuous self-improvement, and I am always eager to take on projects that push me outside my comfort zone.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the future, I hope to work on innovative AI-powered systems, contribute to meaningful tech projects, and continue expanding my knowledge across every area of computer science. My long-term dream is to become a skilled engineer who creates reliable, intelligent, and impactful solutions that make people’s lives easier.
